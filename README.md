# Random_Hypnosis
 
The goal of this software is simple: play hypnosis videos that take over your screen and sound system at random times.

How to use the app:

    If you have video or audio files on your pc:
        Enter a path to a folder where you are storing the videos and/or audios files you want to play (ex: c:/<user>/Documents/videos)
    If you want to play videos from Hypnotube (only website compatible for now)
        Go to Videos from internet and enter the links of your videos
        In Settings, select the "Hypnotube link" option 
    Select a time on the slider. This time represents the maximum amount of time that can go without a video popping up on your screen
    You can now launch the program ;)

App customization:

By going into the Settings, you can

    Set the app to play only video, only audio,  keep bot, or play online videos
    Reduce the range of the slider to be able to entre smaller times
    Select a "dangerosity" mode:  
        Soft Mode: Allows you to leave the video by pressing "q"
        No Escape Mode:  No way to leave once a video is playing, use at your own risks
